#  A very simple Web Sever in Ruby


This is a quick project to practice how the Web works. I have built here mini server in Ruby and also a mini CLI-based client which will send server requests in order to use the client to talk to your server.


## Getting Started

If you want to quick run some the examples to see the code in action, and you have installed Ruby and Rails, run
```
$ ruby first_server.rb
```

This will run a loop/server in CLI and at the following address in the browser at http://0.0.0.0:8080/
